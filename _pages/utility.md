# $CoinBevAI Utility

## Foundation Partnership
MetaBrewSociety, an established brewery in Naila, Bavaria, provides the initial sponsorship for $CoinBevAI through 2025. With a proven track record of delivering real-world utility since September 2022, they set the foundation for our brewery network.

## Reward System
Our streamlined claiming process uses "Staking Reward NFTs" airdropped to eligible wallets.
These NFTs can be burned in participating brewery shops to receive physical beer rewards. Starting with MetaBrew in 2025, we aim to expand this system across multiple breweries worldwide.

## Holding Requirements
- Tokens must remain in ONE wallet for the entire period
- No transfers allowed during holding period
- Holding period resets if tokens are moved
- Rewards are calculated based on lowest token balance during period

## Global Expansion Strategy
Beyond 2025, $CoinBevAI will focus on building a diverse network of brewery partnerships. By leveraging our community's global presence, we'll onboard local breweries in key markets, significantly reducing shipping costs and expanding accessibility for token holders worldwide.

## Current Shipping Costs
While we work towards local partnerships, MetaBrew handles worldwide distribution. The current shipping-costs are:
- Germany: $7.50
- Europe: $15.00
- US/Canada: $45.00
- Australia/NZ: $90.00

## Payment Benefits
MetaBrewSociety leads the way by offering a 15% discount on all purchases made with $CoinBevAI. This model will serve as a blueprint for future brewery partnerships, creating a standardized benefit system across our network.
