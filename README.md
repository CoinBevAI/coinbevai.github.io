# CoinBev.ai
CoinBev.ai is a Jekyll-based website built for the crypto beer revolution. It uses the Minimal Mistakes theme (dark skin) and is auto-deployed to GitLab Pages via a CI/CD pipeline.

It is made by the community with the goal to provide all important information about the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ruby (>= 2.5)
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- Jekyll (`gem install jekyll`)

### Installation
Don't worry, you do not need to touch any ruby code! Thats just the static page generator. If you know Markdown, CSS and HTML, you are perfect!

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/coinbev.ai.git
   cd coinbev.ai
   ```
2. Configure Bundler to use local directory (recommended):
   ```bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'```

   This keeps all dependencies in the project's `vendor` directory instead of installing globally.
   Both `vendor/` and `.bundle/` are gitignored.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bundle install```
3. Start the local server:
   ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
   Then open your browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

   Note: Always run `bundle exec jekyll clean` when:
   - You've modified `_config.yml`
   - You're experiencing caching issues
   - Site updates aren't showing up as expected
   - You want to ensure a fresh build

## Deployment

The site automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Builds the Jekyll site in a clean environment
2. Uploads the built site as an artifact
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

The live site is available at: https://coinbevai.github.io/
